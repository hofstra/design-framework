### Heading Level 3: About the Design Framework

The DRC Projects Design Framework is a consistent set of formatting styles for content elements in, and around, the DRC projects.

### About Jekyll Categories, Tags, and Index

#### categories

By using the plural categories label for a list of categories, in order, we can specify a sequence of categories for grouping, both in page output and as a URL. (i.e., <span class="code">/category-1/category-2/post-url</span>).

Thus categories should be written in lowercase with hyphens in place of spaces.

#### tags

Tags are also populated as a list of text values, but unlike categories, they do not generate URLs. Any number of tags can be applied as a means of fetching similar entries, and tags can be written to be readable, using capital letters and spaces as appropriate.

For tagged entries to appear on a tag page, corresponding <span class="code">tags/_posts</span> files must be created.

#### index

Replacing an earlier use of the Category field with Index, we can output posts in a sorted index with appropriate headings.

#### Heading Level 4 is the same font size as a paragraph, just bold.
